# List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.

1. Loops - I am familiar with loops due to C++ and it having similar structure aswell. There also many practice exercises / opportunities to practice coding with loops.
2. Arithmetic Operators - It involves basic operators similar to that of C++, which means I know how most of them work. It is simple and also understandable to know how it works in JavaScript.
3. Comparative Operators - When given a problem of comparative operators, it was fun to learn how a given statement would work. It was also similar to C++ and I was able to practice with using it.
4. Declaring Variables - While it was different than that of C++, it was simple to understand. I was able to grasp the concept of declaring variables and also experiment with how it can also work.
5. Conditional Statements - I understand how conditional statements such as if and if else help control the flow of a program. They are clear to me because there were many practice exercises this quarter and also in C++.

# List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why. The why should be per topic listed.

1. Functions - I understand the basis of how functions work, but I sometimes get confused with parameters and return values. I need more practice in creating my own functions and applying them to other problems.
2. Switch Statement - The switch statement, while encountering it in C++, is still unfamiliar to me. I find the syntax confusing and learning how to properly use break.
3. Else If Statement - I understand if statements, but I sometimes get confused when using multiple else if conditions. I need more practice analyzing the how it works to avoid mistakes in program flow.
4. HTML Elements - I easily forget the proper use of HTML elements. I do not know how some of it works and I require more practice.
5. Buttons (HTML) - The use of buttons was an entirely new concept to me which was hard to understand at first. I did not know it was also possible to connect functions to buttons aswell.

# Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

* I will review my quizzes and attempt to also ask my classmates what they did after class to reinforce what I learned. I will also practice coding small problems and ask questions whenever I am unsure.

# In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

## Effective

1. Hands-on JavaScript coding exercises helped me apply concepts directly, and I was also able to ask questions regarding the subject making them easier to understand.
2. The Kahoot sessions were fun and also effective as I was able to notice my faults and what I should focus on.

## Not Effective

1. Quick lectures with an entirely new subject / topic made it a bit harder for me to catch up and understand.
2. Being given an entirely new topic without discussion and only given instructions made it a little harder for me to understand, but I was able to ask questions in order to finish it.
